<h3>Errata for AISTATS'17 paper: High-dimensional Time Series Clustering via Cross-Predictability
</h3>

<p>
The authors would like to make the following correction to the original published manuscript. The change does not affect the main results of the paper, but are needed to make the claim technically sound.
</p>

<p>In the original manuscript, we called the proposed "cross-predictability" a metric, for which we can not prove the triangle inequality, and it is therefore a measure, rather than a metric. The claim is corrected in the current <a href=./aistats17-paper.pdf>online version</a>.
</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
The authors would like to thank Dr. Eamonn Keogh from UC Riverside for initiating the discussion that led to the correction in this document.
