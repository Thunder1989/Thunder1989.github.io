Paper summary
-------------
The paper presents a framework to automatically identify the physical context of HVAC equipments in buildings (i.e., how each equipment is connected). Specifically, AHU-VAV functional relationship was investigated. The proposed framework builds upon the insight that functionally connected equipment are exposed to similar events and thus will exhibit correlated changes in their time-series data.

Strengths
---------
* Inferring the physical relationship between HVAC equipment with minimal manual intervention.
* proposed method can filter out irrelevant events, reducing the number of spurious correlations.

Significant Weaknesses
----------------------
* Generality of the framework beyond AHU-VAV connections. For instance, the ability to detect associations between water-side and air-side equipment in a multi-zone HVAC system (e.g., water-cooled VAV system).
* Increase in cooling tower fan speed might not result in a coincidental change in the downstream VAV.

Comments for author
-------------------
The paper presents an interesting study with practical applications. It would be interesting also to see the extendibility of the proposed approach for inferring functional connections between water-side and air-side HVAC equipments (e.g., cooling tower - AHU - VAV).

Minor suggestions to authors:
* An overview of the AHU and VAV data streams (i.e., type of sensors and data collected) used would aid in understanding the context of the study.
* Authors should include the convergence criterion for the Gibbs sampler. i.e., how was convergence assessed?

Paper summary
-------------
In medium to large buildings, there are multiple variable air volume boxes (VAVs)
and multiple air handling units (AHUs). There is a many-one relationship between
VAVs and AHUs, i.e., each AHU can provide air flow to multiple VAVs. The main
problem tackled in the paper is the inference of the association between
VAVs and AHUs, i.e., a given VAV is associated with which AHU.

Methodology wise, at a higher level, the paper first builds a model for inferring
"events" for each AHU and each VAV individually. For AHU, the sensor data used
is the supply fan speed. For VAV the data is the air flow volume. The events are
modeled as hidden latent variables that induce sensor observation changes over
time. The parameters of the models are estimated using Expectation-Maximization.
Once the event sequences for all AHUs and VAVs are computed, for a pair of AHU and
VAV, a similarity score is computed and the highest scored AHU is then assigned
to a given VAV.

The evaluation uses kenos data from 5 buildings over a one month period. The
proposed method is compared with multiple baseline methods. The proposed method
demonstrated sizable advantage in the comparison. Furthermore, it is shown that
the method can be made more automatic (i.e. removing the need of manual
data-device association) without significant loss of accuracy.

Strengths
---------
The methodology developed in the paper is well grounded, i.e., (1) the use of
latent event variables and HMMs for inferring events, and (2) the use of the
events to derive device association. The method appears to be of good generality.
The evaluation is fairly thorough.

Significant Weaknesses
----------------------
The key assumption that the AHU-VAV association is unavailable is very surprising.
It would seem that a building's blueprint would contain such data with ~100%
accuracy; any subsequent changes should also be well documented. Unless the authors
can substantiate the need, i.e., the ground truth is not already available in
most buildings, which they didn't do in the current manuscript, the paper's work
seems not very meaningful.

Comments for author
-------------------
Besides the summary, strengths, and weaknesses mentioned above, some additional
comments:

It would seem that an HMM with sensor observations depending on state changes and
past sensor observations should be a natural comparison point, i.e., is the 3-layer
model necessary? It is not clear that the HMM model used for baseline comparison
in the paper is modeled as this. Please clarify.

In the convergence experimentation (Fig. 8), it uses 8 weeks of data. However,
the paper states that one month worth of data was collected in all five buildings.
This seems contradictory.

In the abstract, I am not sure what is a "non-polynomial combinatorial data
segmentation problem". Do you mean the problem is NP-hard?

Paper summary
-------------
This paper proposes an approach to automatically infer the functional relations of equipment in the building, and evaluates the performance on data from 5 commercial buildings.

Strengths
---------
Inferring the functional relations of building equipment is of great importance to understand the energy behaviors of equipment and explore the energy saving opportunities.

Significant Weaknesses
----------------------
More literature review would be helpful to justify the necessity and contributions of the proposed approach, as inferring the relations of time-series data for building equipment has been extensively studied already.
